Hi, I’m @rzambrano1. I am a data scientist and an econometrician.

I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, Sampling Methodology, Big Data, and Econometrics. In the long term I would like to participate in interdisciplinary projects involving machine learning applications. 

I'm a big fan of good music (Funk, Acid Jazz, Progressive Rock, etc.); Sci-Fi Novels; and mindblowing Podcasts and YouTube series, such as: Mindscape, PBS's Spacetime, and VSauce.
