- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rzambrano1. I am a data scientist and an econometrician.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, Sampling Methodology, Big Data, and Econometrics. 
     In the short term I am looking forward to becoming a full-time practitioner of Machine Learning.
     In the long term I would like to participate in interdisciplinary projects involving machine learning applications. I have several areas of interest in which I would like to implement machine learning algorithms: economics, finance, behavior of social groups, simulating human conciousness, and industrial predictive maintenance (i.e. water treatment, power generation, and power transmission). I have either hands-on experience or academic training in these fields. I dream of integrating these areas of knowledge with machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I am enrolled in a Machine Learning Master's program. In my free time I like to read about python, mathematics, algorithms, and other technologies, such as R or C++. I believe that cultivating these skills will help me  become a stronger programmer. 
- ðŸŽµ I'm a big fan of good music (Funk, Acid Jazz, Progressive Rock, etc.); Sci-Fi Novels; and mindblowing Podcasts and YouTube series, such as: Mindscape, PBS's Spacetime, and VSauce. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
