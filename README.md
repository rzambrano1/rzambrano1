- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rzambrano1. I go by Ric.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, Sampling, Big Data, and Econometrics. 
     In the short and medium term I just want to be a full-time practitioner of Data Science.
     In the long term I would like to become a machine learning engineer. I have several areas of interest in which I would like to implement machine learning algorithms: economics, finance, forecast of the behavior of social groups, and industrial predictive maintenance (water treatment, power generation and transmission specifically).
- ðŸŒ± While I am attempting to get a degree in Machine Learning, I would like to become more proficient at algorithms and learn C++. I have the idea that these will help me  become a stronger programmer and a better suited data scientist. 
     I am trying to keep sharpening my knowledge of linear regression, time series, panel data, R, and Python. Sometime in the future, I will also like to take a deeper dive into probability theory, stochastic processes, Monte Carlo simulation, linear algebra, optimization and tensor mathematics.
- ðŸŽµ I'm a big fan of the Mindscape Podcast, PBS's Spacetime, Progressive Rock, Sci-Fi Novels.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
