- 👋 Hi, I’m @rzambrano1. I go by Ric or Ricky.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, Sampling, Big Data, and Econometrics. 
     In the short and medium term I just want to be a full time practicioner of Data Science.
     In the long term I would like to attempt designing a machine learning algorithm that would replace current economic models. The economics standard model
     is based on assumptions that have been widely debunked. Likewise, given its mathematical foundations economics likes to compare itself with the natural sciences,
     however its track in history solving the problems it sets sosolve has shown poor performance in comparison with other natural sciences such as:
     biology, physics, and engineering. In my opinion, is not a field free from ideology. 
     Given these reasons, I think that economics has been ripe for disruption for a while. This is an opportunity to do research and hopefully create value and progress.
- 🌱 I would like to become more proeficient at algorithms in order to become a strong programmer. I am currently trying to learn C++ and Java, the first to have a 
     compiled language in my tool bag the second because they told me I needed to be a strong Java programmer in order to be able to handle big data with Hadoop.
     I am trying to sharpen my knowledge in linear regression, time series, panel data, R, and Python. I will also like to take a deeper dive in Machine Learning methods, 
     Monte Carlo simulation, probability, bayesian statistics, and economic dynamics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- 🎵 I'm a big fan of the Mindscape Podcast, PBS's Spacetime, Progressive Rock, Sci-Fi Novels.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
