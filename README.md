# Hi, I’m Ric (@rzambrano1)

I am a **Data Scientist and Statistician** specializing in the intersection of **causal inference, survey methodology, and machine learning.** I bridge the gap between rigorous econometric theory and scalable production code.

### Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python 🐍 (Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Librosa, Stable Baselines3), R (tidyverse, brms, glmnet), SQL, Bash. 
* **Learning:** Rust 🦀 and CUDA.
* **Specialties:** Reinforcement Learning, Survey Methodology, Big Data (PySpark, BigQuery), and NLP.

### Production & Methodology
* **Engineering:** Refactoring legacy code for AWS/GCP production environments and building custom Python/R wrappers for automated ML pipelines.
* **Statistical Methods:** Causal Inference, LASSO/Regularization, Time Series, Bayesian Modeling (MCMC), Sampling, and Survey Methodology.

### Interest & Collaboration
I am interested in contributing to **open-source projects** and exploring **industrial applications for reinforcement learning** and computational statistics.
